## Features

- Superuser: This system has a superuser who has full control of the application and can manage the other roles.

- Roles: The system has three different roles: buyer, seller, and deposit. Each one is responsible for a specific part of stock control.

- Product registration: All the products you add to the system will be saved in Firebase, where you can access them at any time to verify their available quantity.

- Stock control: The system will allow you to verify the available quantity of your products at all times, which will help you make informed decisions about when it is necessary to reorder.
